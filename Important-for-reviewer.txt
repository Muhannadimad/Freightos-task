Hi reviewer, hope you are doing well!!

I just want to share some notes with you about my solution:

1- I couldn't build the java project because of this dependency "nashorn-core", I tried various way to install it
for example I tried to change the pom file and adding the new dependency but I failed, I tried to add a new repo in the
pom file but it didn't work, so what I did I built the proj without that pkg, the image is not correct you can't lunch container
based on it but I built the image just to test the Dockerfile.

2- To be honest my experiance in CICD pipelines is very very basic, if you noticed I didn't add that skill in my resume.
but I managed to run jenkins as a container and I created a basic pipeline but it didn't work :(
(+ I am fast learner ^_^, I could do more if I have time).

3- regard new tests on the project I added a file contain the idea, I believe you wanna have the implementation but as I mentioned 
I couldn't run the project + I don't have experiance in spring boot framework in java.

I hope that will qualify me to join your team!

Thanks,
Muhannad
